 9.2 free
 
10. on vehicule DEL status (section 6.x):
  10.1 write a function to turn on off given condition

11. free

12. For PID programming, use duetimer library with specific timer instead of firts timer
    provided by init function. This way we'll always be shure of time ID.
    
13. free
14. GREEN DEL on vehicule turns on when init done and vehicule ready DONE

15. XBee works at 115200 bps OK

  16.2 bug when joystick is realeased (autocenter): motor are not stopped
  

17. Issue 2.13.2. motor speed should be set from 1 to 10 ABANDONNED
branch motor_1_to_10 merged to master and deleted

18. Issue 5.1.1 #defines on branch «definitions_for_debugs» DONE

19. Issue 6.2.3 Simple messages Tx for debugs trought telemetry

20. Issue 2.5.10 TELEOP using simple commands trough telemetry (Xbee)

21. Nextion devel is on laptop. copy on kva and document using print screens
   This is project 23 in sketches binder

22. HMI has some issues: branch debug_hmi
  22.1 page 1 only update comming from page 0 (ok from page 2)
  22.2 page 2 (RTC) fields from RTC do not update, check RTC status first
  22.3 // page changes callbacks, order by page number : is page 0 missing?
  22.4 dbSerialPrintln vs my debug(x)???????

23. issue todo001 : RTC not responding
  23.1 tested on sketch on RTC_DS3231_r_glage_v3.ino on Uno: RTC working and date and time set OK
  23.2 replaced on KVA vehicule OK
  23.3 bug RTC not found!:
    23.3.1 had it connected to pins SCL1 and SDA1 instead of SCL 20 and SDA 21 now OK
    23.3.2 where is this confusion come from???????????????????
    23.3.3 RTC seems to retain dt, but HMI does'nt work properly, but does sometimes:
     - usage of Serial.print in updateDisplayAndIndicators in each loop seems ti interfere with the working of
       HMI regarding RTC.
     - only works for a time then fucks up!

  23.4 in updateDisplayAndIndicators, check on availability of RTC and report with YELLOW LED and status on HMI page 1
  23.5 label cable for RTC correctly and update annex B
