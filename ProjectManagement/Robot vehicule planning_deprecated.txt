2. Wiring motors Hall sensors for speed and direction measurements or PID control.
3. Controling motors with a joystick (PRECOM mode).
4. Measuring motors speed and direction using Hall sensors.
5. With motors mounted in close proximity, determine if Hall sensors affect each other.
6. Controling motors by software (not PRECOM mode) while regulating motors speed with PID, no turns.
